# stock-market-data-warehouse
This project creates load files for a Fact table and a Dimension table which is loaded after very simple transformations for the stock market data. The time dimension is loaded as is from Sisense.

This project is pretty useless but wanted to create something simple using [rust] (https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)

# Data
Stock market data from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs)

Date data from [Sisense] (https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/articles/230644208-Date-Dimension-File)
