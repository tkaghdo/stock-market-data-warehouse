# stock-market-data-warehouse
This project creates load files for a Fact table and a Dimension table which is loaded after very simple transformations for the stock market data. The time dimension is loaded as is from Sisense.

This project is pretty useless but I wanted to create something simple using rust

# Data
Stock market data from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs)

Date data from [Sisense] (https://support.sisense.com/hc/en-us/articles/230644208-Date-Dimension-File)
